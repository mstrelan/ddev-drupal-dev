# DDEV Drupal Dev

A DDEV add-on for working on Drupal core and contrib modules together, using a core git checkout as the project root.

Other add-ons target either core or contrib in isolation. This one is for when you need both: developing a contrib module against the latest core, fixing a core bug that affects contrib, or running contrib tests on a core patch.

Extra dependencies (contrib modules, Drush, dev tools) are managed through a `composer.local.json` overlay, keeping core's `composer.json` and `composer.lock` untouched.

## Installation

Clone Drupal core and configure DDEV to use it as the project root:

```bash
git clone https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git drupal-dev
cd drupal-dev
ddev config --project-type=drupal
ddev start
```

Then install the add-on:

```bash
ddev add-on get amateescu/ddev-drupal-dev
ddev restart
ddev composer install
```

## Working on contrib modules

Use `ddev add-module` to clone a contrib module for development:

```bash
ddev add-module token
ddev add-module token 2.0.x     # specific branch
ddev add-module --https token   # or use HTTPS (no push access)
```

The clone runs on your host, so it uses your host SSH keys directly; no `ddev auth ssh` needed.

This clones the module into `modules/contrib/`, registers it as a path repository in `composer.local.json`, and runs `composer require`, all in one step.

The module is a preserved git checkout. Composer detects the `.git` directory and skips re-downloading it. Its dependencies are resolved through the overlay, keeping core's files untouched.

You can work on multiple modules this way; each gets its own git checkout that you can commit and push to independently.

The overlay includes [composer-drupal-lenient](https://github.com/mglaman/composer-drupal-lenient), so contrib modules that don't yet declare compatibility with your core version (e.g. working on `main`/12.x-dev with a module that only supports `^11`) will still install.

### Switching branches

After switching a module's git branch, update the Composer constraint to match:

```bash
cd modules/contrib/token && git checkout 2.0.x && cd -
ddev update-module token
```

### Removing a contrib module

```bash
ddev remove-module token
```

This removes the composer requirement, unsets the path repository, and deletes the cloned directory. It will abort if the module has uncommitted changes.

### Installing a contrib module without cloning

If you just need a module as a dependency (not for active development), require it directly:

```bash
ddev composer require drupal/pathauto
```

## Working on core

Core's `composer.json` and `composer.lock` are never modified by the overlay. You work on core normally: edit files, run tests, commit, create patches.

## Reproducing core's exact dependency versions

When reproducing a core bug or validating a patch, you sometimes need the same resolved dependency versions as core's `composer.lock`. By default the overlay's solver runs fresh, so shared packages (Symfony, Guzzle, etc.) may resolve to newer versions than core recorded.

Enable pinning to keep every shared package at core's locked version:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "drupal-dev": {
            "pin-core-lock": true
        }
    }
}
```

Then `ddev composer update` to re-solve with pinning applied. Packages that appear in core's `composer.lock` are pinned to the exact version (and commit SHA, for dev refs); overlay-only packages resolve normally. Subsequent `ddev composer install` runs replay the pinned `composer.local.lock` unchanged.

Pinning affects the solve step, so after enabling (or disabling) the flag you need to run `ddev composer update` once to regenerate `composer.local.lock`. Core's lock is re-read on every solve, so there is no separate refresh step.

Disable it by setting the flag to `false` or removing the key, then `ddev composer update`.

## Running tests

Tests run against your project's configured database by default. Use `--db` to switch:

```bash
ddev phpunit core/modules/node                  # project database (default)
ddev phpunit --db=sqlite core/modules/node      # SQLite
ddev phpunit --db=pgsql core/modules/node       # PostgreSQL
ddev phpunit modules/contrib/token              # contrib module tests
```

For PostgreSQL, install the [ddev-postgres](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-postgres) add-on first.

## Adding other packages

Any package can be added through the overlay:

```bash
ddev composer require drush/drush
ddev composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan
```

## Working from the host

Inside DDEV, `ddev composer` always uses the overlay automatically. On the host, bare `composer`, `drush` and `php` will bypass DDEV. To prevent that, use one of these options:

### Shell helpers (recommended)

The add-on includes a shell helpers script that wraps `composer`, `drush`, `php` and `phpunit`, automatically delegating to DDEV when you're inside a DDEV project and falling back to the host binary otherwise.

Add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
source /path/to/your/project/.ddev/drupal-dev/shell-helpers.sh
```

### direnv

An `.envrc` file is created during installation. If you have [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) installed, run:

```bash
direnv allow
```

This sets the `COMPOSER` env var on the host so that running `composer` directly on the host uses the overlay. Note that direnv cannot export shell functions, so you still need the shell helpers above for `composer`, `drush`, `php` and `phpunit` delegation.

## Command reference

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `ddev phpunit [path]` | Run PHPUnit tests |
| `ddev add-module <name>` | Clone a contrib module for development |
| `ddev update-module <name>` | Update composer constraint after switching a module's branch |
| `ddev remove-module <name>` | Remove a previously cloned contrib module |

## How it works

1. A `composer.local.json` file lives in the core root (ignored via `.gitignore`).
2. It requires `wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin`, which pulls in everything from core's `composer.json`.
3. The `COMPOSER` env var is set to `composer.local.json` inside the DDEV web container, so Composer reads the overlay instead of core's file.
4. Result: a unified `vendor/` and autoloader with both core's deps and your extras, while core's `composer.json` and `composer.lock` remain untouched.
5. A custom Composer plugin (`drupal-dev/composer-git-installer`) intercepts installs for `drupal-module`, `drupal-theme`, and `drupal-profile` packages. If a `.git` directory already exists at the install path, the download is skipped and the package is registered in the installed repository so autoloading works correctly.
6. When `extra.drupal-dev.pin-core-lock` is enabled, the same plugin subscribes to Composer's pre-pool-create event and filters the solver's candidate pool against core's `composer.lock`, so shared packages can only resolve to their locked versions.

Only `composer.local.json` and `composer.local.lock` are written (both ignored via `.gitignore`).

## Advanced

### Changing the module directory layout

By default, modules are installed into `modules/contrib/` (the standard Drupal layout). Both `ddev add-module` and the Composer plugin read the `installer-paths` from your Composer configuration, so you can change the layout by overriding it in `composer.local.json`:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "installer-paths": {
            "modules/{$name}": ["type:drupal-module"]
        }
    }
}
```

### What happens if you run bare `composer install`

It's harmless. It just overwrites `vendor/` with only core's deps, losing any overlay packages until re-installed. Fix it with:

```bash
ddev composer install
```

## Upgrading

When upgrading the add-on, your `composer.local.json` is preserved (it contains your modules and custom packages). If a new version of the add-on introduces changes to the base `composer.local.json`, check `.ddev/drupal-dev/composer.local.json` for any new dependencies and add them manually.

## Comparison with other add-ons

- **[ddev-drupal-core-dev](https://github.com/justafish/ddev-drupal-core-dev)** -- Core development only. Same project layout (core git checkout), but no contrib module or Composer management. Use this if you only work on core.
- **[ddev-drupal-contrib](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-drupal-contrib)** -- Single contrib module development. Core is pulled in as a Composer dependency. Use this if you work on one contrib module and don't need a core checkout.
- **[ddev-drupal-suite](https://github.com/lussoluca/ddev-drupal-suite)** -- Multiple contrib modules. Similar to ddev-drupal-contrib but supports working on several modules at once. Core is a dependency, not a checkout.
