# These functions delegate composer, drush, php and phpunit to DDEV when
# you're inside a DDEV project directory, and fall back to the host binary
# otherwise.

# Double-underscore prefix avoids zsh compinit treating these as completion
# function autoload stubs (single _ prefix is the completion-function convention).
